      <h2>Lobster</h2>



<ul>
  <li> Lobsters are one of the arthropod family. </li>
  <li>Lobsters have long bodies with muscular tails, and live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor.</li>
  <li> Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, including the first pair, which are usually much larger than the others.</li>
  <li>Lobsters are invertebrates with a hard protective exoskeleton. Like most arthropods, lobsters must moult to grow, which leaves them vulnerable.</li>

        <h2>Hermit Crab</h2>
        <p>Hermit crabs can be divided into two groups:</p>
        <p> A) Marine hermit crabs</p>
       <ul>
         <li> These crabs spend most of their life underwater as aquatic animals, live in varying depths of saltwater from shallow reefs and shorelines to deep sea bottoms and rarely leave for land. </li>
         <li>They breathe through gills but they don't have to carry around their water to do so. </li>
          <li> Most can survive briefly out of water as long as their gills are damp.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> B) Land hermit crabs</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The land hermit crabs, spend most of their life on land as terrestrial species in tropical areas, though even they require access to both freshwater and saltwater to keep their gills damp or wet to survive and to reproduce.</li>
        <li>They belong to the family Coenobitidae. Of the approximately 15 terrestrial species of genus Coenobita in the world, the following are commonly kept as pets:</li>

          <h1> Barnacle</h1>


<ul>
  <li> A barnacle is a type of arthropod constituting the infraclass Cirripedia in the subphylum Crustacea, and is hence related to crabs and lobsters.</li>
  <li> Barnacles are exclusively marine, and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters, typically in erosive settings.</li>
  <li> Barnacles are encrusters, attaching themselves permanently to a hard substrate.</li>
