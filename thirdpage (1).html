         <h1>The important of coral reef</h1>
         <h3>Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, is the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries.
            At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms produce oxygen.
            Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.</h3>

         <h1>The Impact of Extinction</h1>
         <h3>the effects of it would be much worse. If animals were extinct, humans would lose one of their main sources of food. Sure, humans could all become vegetarians but on the long term,
            vegetables will not be able to give us enough energy to be able to sustain us. Without animals, the whole environment will topple as animals, the major player in ensuring that things do not go wrong, has gone extinct. Animals help to fertilize the soil with their dung and also help make the soil airy so that plants
            can grow better. Without animals, plants will not be able to grow healthily.</h3>

         <h1>The Cause of Extinction and How to Prevent it</h1>
         <h3>Humans can cause extinction of a species through overharvesting, pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species (such as new predators and food competitors), overhunting, and other influences.
           Explosive, unsustainable human population growth is an essential cause of the extinction crisis. There are a few ways to prevent from extinction for example,
         Native plants provide food and shelter for native wildlife. Attracting native insects like bees and butterflies can help pollinate your plants. The spread of non-native species has greatly impacted native populations around the world.
       Next,  Recycle and buy sustainable products.â€¨Buy recycled paper, sustainable products like bamboo and Forest Stewardship Council wood products to protect forest species. </h3>
