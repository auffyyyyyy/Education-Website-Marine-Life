      <h2>Catfish</h2>



<ul>
  <li>Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish.</li>
  <li>Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior.</li>
  <li>the three largest species alive, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the piraíba of South America</li>
  <li>Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbels.</li>
  <li>Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder</li>
  <li>Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food</li>
  <li>Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby</li>
  <li>Many catfish are nocturnal,[3][4] but others (many Auchenipteridae) are crepuscular or diurnal</li>

        <h2>Tilapia</h2>

       <ul>
         <li>Tilapia (/tɪˈlɑːpiə/ tih-LAH-pee-ə) is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the tilapiine cichlid tribe</li>
         <li> Tilapia are mainly freshwater fish inhabiting shallow streams, ponds, rivers, and lakes, and less commonly found living in brackish water</li>
          <li> Historically, they have been of major importance in artisanal fishing in Africa, and they are of increasing importance in aquaculture and aquaponics</li>
           <li>Tilapia can become a problematic invasive species in new warm-water habitats such as Australia,[2] whether deliberately or accidentally introduced, but generally not in temperate climates due to their inability to survive in cold water.</li>
            <li>  Tilapia is the fourth-most consumed fish in the United States dating back to 2002. The popularity of tilapia came about due to its low price, easy preparation, and mild taste.</li>

          <h1> European Lampreys River</h1>


<ul>
  <li>Adult river lampreys measure from 25 to 40 cm (10 to 16 in) for the sea-going forms and up to 28 cm (11 in) for the lake forms</li>
  <li> The very elongate body is a uniform dark grey above, lightening to yellowish off-white on the sides and pure white below</li>
  <li>Like all lampreys, these fish lack paired fins and possess a circular sucking disc instead of jaws</li>
  <li>They have a single nostril and seven small breathing holes on either side behind the eye</li>
  <li>The teeth are sharp and these fish can be told from the rather smaller brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri) by the fact that the two dorsal fins are more widely separated</li>
  <li>The European river lamprey is found in coastal waters around almost all of Europe from the north-west Mediterranean Sea north to the lakes of Finland, Scotland, Norway (Lake Mjosa), Wales (Cors Caron), and Russia, including rivers in the Alps</li>
  <li> Initially, in 1996, its conservation status was rated Near Threatened but since 2008 it has been rated as being of Least Concern following recovery of populations after pollution problems in central and western Europe.[4] An assessment for the Baltic Sea published in 2014, however, classified the river lamprey as Near Threatened in this region</li>
  <li>]In August 2018, Spain declared it officially extinct in its territory</li>
