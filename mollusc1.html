      <h2>Cockle(Mollusk)</h2>



<ul>
  <li>Cockle, also called heart clam, any of the approximately 250 species of marine bivalve mollusks, or clams, of the family Cardiidae.</li>
  <li>The two valves of the shell are equal in size and shape, and range in colour from brown to red or yellow</li>
  <li> Those of many species are quite smooth; others have ribs radiating from the hinge area between the shells.</li>
  <li> Cockles feed on microscopic organisms that they collect from the water.</li>

</ul>

        <h2>Cuttlefish (Chephalopod)</h2>

       <ul>
         <li> Cuttlefish, any of several marine cephalopods of the order Sepioidea, related to the octopus and squid and characterized by a thick internal calcified shell called the cuttlebone.  </li>
         <li> All species have eight arms and two longer tentacles that are used in capturing prey and can be withdrawn into two pouches. </li>
          <li> Suction disks are located on the arms and on expanded pads at the tips of the tentacles.</li>
        <li>Sepia species feed mainly on crustaceans, small fishes, and each other.Their main enemies are large aquatic animals. </li>

          <h1> Nudibranch(GASTROPOD)</h1>


<ul>
  <li> Nudibranch, also called sea slug, any of the marine gastropods that constitute the order Nudibranchia (subclass Opisthobranchia of the class Gastropoda).</li>
  <li>Nudibranchs possess a radular feeding organ, but they characteristically lack a shell, gills, and mantle cavity typical of other mollusks. </li>
  <li>Nudibranchs occur in the shallow waters of all the worldâ€™s oceans, where they feed chiefly on other invertebrates, particularly sea anemones.</li>
