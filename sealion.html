      <h2>5 Facts about Sea Lions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>They’re mammals – That makes sense, considering the “lion” part of the name.
           Sea lions give birth to live pups, and the females produce milk to nurse their young – just like puppies!</li>
        <li>There are many species of sea lions – There are actually seven different species
           even though they all often seem to be bundled into the same category. Sea lions belong to a group of animals called “pinnipeds.”</li>
        <li>The bigger, the better – Male sea lions grow to be pretty big – much larger than females.
           The females look for the largest males to mate with, so in this case, yes, bigger is better.</li>
        <li>The Northern Atlantic Ocean is off-limits – You can find sea lions in bodies of water throughout the world –
           except for the Northern Atlantic Ocean. This is strange since its temperatures are certainly compatible with where sea lions typically live,
           and there’s plenty of food there. Scientists have no idea why sea lions refuse to live in this area.</li>
        <li> They can have age-related health issues. When they grow older, sea lions become prone to pneumonia, epilepsy, and cancer.</li>

      <h2>For a very long time humans were responsible for the declining numbers. Today it is illegal in many areas to hunt,
         harm, or kill a Sea Lion. However, this doesn’t stop such events from taking place illegally. In some countries
          including Japan there are laws to protect Sea Lions but they simply aren’t enforced.
         It isn’t just humans though as there are some natural problems that continue to threaten Sea Lions as well.</h2>
