      <p>The largest phylum of creatures on Earth without a doubt is Arthropoda, both in terms of number of species and in total number of individuals.All Arthropods share certain characteristics making them unique from other phyla.
        Most obvious is the external skeleton (technically, not really a shell). Not only does this exoskeleton protect the animal like a suit of armor, but it actually does serve as the animal's skeleton.
        The muscles of an Arthropod are connected to the inside of the exoskeleton, because the animal lacks an internal skeleton of any type.The exoskeleton is made of a tough substance called chitin (KIE-tin). The animal secretes this hard material from cells in the underlying epidermis.
        Because the exoskeleton cannot grow, the animal must periodically shed its armor in order to grow. This process is called molting. The animal must first grow a soft exoskeleton underneath the principal exoskeleton. Then, the animal grows enough within the principal exoskeleton to crack it.
        The animal then crawls out of its old exoskeleton and allows the new soft one to grow and harden. New exoskeletons are usually too large for the animal at the time of the molt, and the animal must grow into the new exoskeleton. This allows reasonable time between molts. Immediately after an Arthropod has molted, it is quite vulnerable because it is essentially defenseless.
        During this period, the animal will hide and wait for its armor to harden. Lobsters caught during this period of time are sometimes called "soft-shelled" because they feel noticeably soft.</p>
