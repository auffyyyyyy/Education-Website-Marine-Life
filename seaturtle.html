      <h2>5 Facts about Sea Turtle</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>They think jellyfish are delicious.Leatherbacks and hawkbill turtles feed on jellyfish and keep their populations in check.
          Plastic looks like jellyfish when it's floating in the water and that's why so many turtles die from
          ingesting plasticâ€”they were going for a tasty snack.</li>

        <li>They're the oceans' lawnmowers. Green sea turtles have a more plant-based diet and eat seagrass. By keeping seagrass short,
          they prevent it from getting tall and harming other marine creatures.</li>

        <li>They cannot retract into their shell like other turtles. Since they don't have to protect themselves from predators for most of their
           life on water, sea turtles cannot retract their flippers and head into their shells. Their anatomy makes them more agile when under
            the sea but highly vulnerable when nesting and hatching.</li>

        <li>They've been around for a very, very long time. An estimated 110 million years is how long
           sea turtles have existed on Earth, which means they once shared the planet with T-Rex and other dinosaurs.</li>

        <li>They can hold their breath for five hours underwater. To accomplish this mighty feat they slow their heart rate to up
           to nine minutes in between heart beats in order to conserve oxygen.</li>

      <h2>Threats from Illegal Shell Trade</h2>
      <p>  Hawksbill sea turtles, recognized for their beautiful gold and brown shells, have been hunted for centuries to create jewelry and other luxury items. As a result, these turtles are now listed as critically endangered. They are especially threatened in the Indian and Pacific oceans and along the Caribbean Coast. According to recent studies, scientists estimate that hawksbill populations have declined by 90 percent during the past 100 years. To improve their survival outlook, an international agreement signed by 173 governments, known as CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), declared the trade of these shells illegal.
