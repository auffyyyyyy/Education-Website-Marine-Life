      <h2>Gorgonian ( Sea Fans)</h2>



<ul>
  <li> This family of soft coral is also called sea whips or sea fans. </li>
  <li>Individual tiny polyps form colonies that are normally erect, flattened, branching, and reminiscent of a fan.</li>
  <li> Gorgonians are found primarily in shallow waters, though some have been found at depths of several thousand feet.</li>
  <li>The more fan-shaped and flexible gorgonians tend to populate shallower areas with strong currents, while the taller, thinner, and stiffer gorgonians can be found in deeper, calmer waters.</li>

</ul>

        <h2>Carnation Coral</h2>

       <ul>
         <li> Easily one of the most beautiful soft corals in the ocean the carnation coral comes in a spectacular range of colors and flourish below underhangs and caves. </li>
         <li>They are found mostly in Indo-Pacific – Islands of the Indopacific including Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands and the Great Barrier Reef. </li>
          <li> Unfortunately this specimen of soft coral is extremely sensitive to changes in water chemistry and is on the decline.</li>

          <h1> Tree Corals</h1>


<ul>
  <li>They are usually attached to hard surfaces including boulders, jetty pilings and coral rubble.  </li>
  <li>  A thick ‘main trunk’ attaches to a hard surface on one end, with many small branches on the other end which is why they are referred to as Tree Coral.</li>
  <li>The Carnation Coral Dendronephthya belong to this family of soft corals.</li>
